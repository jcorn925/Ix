# Ix Memory — Claude Code Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that makes Claude use Ix for codebase searches instead of
native `Grep`/`Glob`, and keeps the Ix graph current as Claude edits files.

## What It Does

| Trigger | Hook | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| Claude runs `Grep` or `Glob` | `PreToolUse` → `ix-intercept.sh` | Runs `ix text` + `ix locate` (or `ix inventory`) first and injects results into Claude's context before the native tool fires |
| Claude runs `Write`, `Edit`, or `MultiEdit` | `PostToolUse` → `ix-ingest.sh` (async) | Ingests the changed file into the Ix graph silently in the background |

Both hooks bail silently if `ix` is not in PATH or the Ix backend is unreachable.

## Why Hooks Instead of MCP

- **No user approval prompt** — hooks fire silently and automatically
- **Guaranteed execution** — every Grep/Glob gets front-run, every edit gets ingested
- **Token-efficient** — Ix returns structured, bounded results vs. raw file content

## Installation

**1. Add the Ix marketplace (one-time):**

```
/plugin marketplace add ix-infrastructure/Ix
```

**2. Install the plugin:**

```
/plugin install ix-memory
```

**3. Restart Claude Code.** Verify the hooks loaded with `/hooks`.

## Requirements

- `ix` CLI in PATH and Ix backend running (`ix status` should return ok)
- `jq` in PATH (used to parse hook JSON input)
- `ripgrep` (`rg`) in PATH — required by `ix text` for file-level text search

Install missing deps:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install jq ripgrep

# macOS
brew install jq ripgrep
```

## How the Intercept Hook Works

When Claude runs `Grep "verify_token"`:

1. `ix-intercept.sh` fires with the tool input as JSON on stdin
2. Script runs `ix text "verify_token" --limit 20 --format json`
3. Script also runs `ix locate "verify_token" --limit 10 --format json`
4. Results are returned as `additionalContext` — injected into Claude's next context window
5. Claude sees the Ix results and typically uses them instead of waiting for Grep output

For `Glob`, the script runs `ix inventory` (optionally filtered by path) instead.

## How the Ingest Hook Works

When Claude edits a file:

1. `ix-ingest.sh` fires asynchronously after the edit succeeds
2. Reads `tool_input.file_path` from stdin
3. Runs `ix ingest <file_path>` silently
4. Returns a short `additionalContext` confirmation: `[ix] Graph updated — ingested: <path>`

## Uninstall

Remove the `hooks` block from `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `.claude/settings.json` for
project-scoped installs), then restart Claude Code.
